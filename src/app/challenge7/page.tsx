        Think that you have an unlimited number of carrots, but a limited number
        of carrot types. Also, you have one bag that can hold a limited weight.
        Each type of carrot has a weight and a price. Write a function that
        takes carrotTypes and capacity and return the maximum value the bag can
        hold. [Python or Javascript]
